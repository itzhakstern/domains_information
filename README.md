## Description

Suunto is a system that combines a REST API server and a scheduling system for information about domains.

The system is written in TypeScript using NestJS as a framework.

The objective of the system is to provide a user interface that allows to retrieval a relevant information through dedicated service integration.

The REST API is built from two endpoints.
- Endpoint to receive GET requests with a domain in the body and does the following:
  - If the domain exists in the system and is in DONE status -> return the information about it.
  - If the domain exists in the system but with PENDING status -> return a message that there is no information about the domain and please come back later to check.
  - If the domain does not exist in the system -> enter it into the system with PENDING status and return a message that there is no information about the domain and please come back later to check.
- Endpoint to receive POST requests with domain in the body of the request and:
  - If the domain exists in the system -> update the status to PENDING.
  - Otherwise, enter it into the system with PENDING status.

In addition, the system has a timer that performs the following actions:
- Once a minute, fetches from the database all the domains with PENDING status and runs a scan on them to get the desired information on them, and updates it in the database.
- Once every 10 minutes, fetches from the database all the domains whose updatedAt was before a certain predetermined period of time (by default I set a month) and runs a repeat scan on them to update the information on them
